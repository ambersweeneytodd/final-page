  <p>My name is Amber Sweeney and this is my final page (if you couldn't tell) I'm a member of plenty of groups which down below shows what my role
    is in each. I've always wanted to go into music once I get out of highschool and that's my plan still. While I don't know exactly what I would
    want to do I'm leaning more towards the vocal side. I love doing things with theatre and on a stage. It might be a bit weird to see me in a class
    like this but part of me doesn't know if there is something else I would love since I've always been focused on music. If this project goes well
    then maybe this is something I should look more into. On this page you'll find some of my best work, see what I have learned throughout this term,
    what's next for me involving classes like this with a few surprises along the way! <b><i>Hit the 'to the top' button and run the cursor underneath the
    orange line to find the links to the other pages!</i></b> Thanks for reading! :)
