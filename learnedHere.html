<h2> <b>What I've Learned</b></h2>
<br>
<div class="left">
<p> During my time in this I've learned lots of valuable things. Before this class I didn't know the first thing about coding
or programming. When I first looked at the screen for coding on FreeCodeCamp the first day I was thinking 'there's no way
I can figure this out' and I asked the people in class for help but sometimes I felt dumb not understanding anything.
Eventually as I kept working on projects and other things for this class I started gradually started understanding things.
Without code camp and my classmates help I probably wouldn't have understood a lot until recently. Hopefully I can figure
out this project as well as many more projects I'll do in the future!</p>
